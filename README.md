# Battle Tank Game

Welcome to the repository for my Battle Tank Game project! ðŸŽ®ðŸ’¥

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the development of an exciting Battle Tank Game, highlighting my skills as a solo developer. The game features engaging tank battles, advanced AI behavior, and optimized gameplay mechanics.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture:** Utilized the Model-View-Controller pattern to efficiently manage player tanks, enemy tanks, and bullets, ensuring a modular and scalable codebase.

- **Advanced AI with State Machine:** Implemented a robust state machine for enemy tanks, enhancing their decision-making capabilities, resulting in dynamic and challenging gameplay.

- **Efficient Object Pooling:** Employed Object Pooling for bullets, reducing memory overhead and optimizing game performance by reusing objects.

- **Observer Pattern for Achievements:** Integrated the Observer pattern to create an Achievement Service, enabling efficient tracking and notification of player achievements.

- **Unity Profiler Optimization:** Utilized Unity Profiler to identify and optimize critical code areas, ensuring smooth gameplay experiences for players.
